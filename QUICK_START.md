ngrok http 3000

# 3. Copy the https:// URL (e.g., https://abc123.ngrok.io)

# 4. Go to Twilio console:
https://console.twilio.com/us1/develop/phone-numbers/manage/incoming

# 5. Find your number (SID: PN24c4e17c80c27c90da28f9899965b799)

## ðŸ“± Your Twilio Info

Find these in your Twilio console:
- **Account SID**: (find in Twilio dashboard)
- **Phone Number**: (find in Phone Numbers section)

**Find your actual phone number:**
1. Go to: https://console.twilio.com/us1/develop/phone-numbers/manage/incoming
2. Click on your phone number
3. Use this number for customer call forwarding

---

## ðŸ§ª Testing

Once webhook is configured:

1. **Call your Twilio number**
2. You should hear the AI agent
3. Have a conversation!
4. Check logs to see it working

**View logs:**
- **Local**: Watch terminal where `npm run dev` is running
- **Railway**: Dashboard â†’ Your service â†’ Logs

## ðŸ‘¥ Customer Setup

Once working, customers forward their line to your Twilio number:

**Mobile forwarding:**
- AT&T/Verizon: `*72` + [your Twilio number]
- T-Mobile: `**21*` + [your Twilio number] + `#`

**Business lines:**
- Contact their provider to set up forwarding

## ðŸ†˜ Need Help?

**Server not starting?**
```bash
# Check if something is using port 3000
netstat -ano | findstr :3000

# Try a different port
# Edit .env: PORT=3001
npm run dev
```

**Webhook failing?**
- URL must be `https://` not `http://`
- Check server is running (visit `/health`)
- Review Twilio debugger for errors

**No audio?**
- Check server logs for WebSocket errors
- Verify OpenAI API key is valid
- Test by calling Twilio number directly
