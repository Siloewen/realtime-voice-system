# Twilio Configuration - What to Change

## üì± Your Phone Number

Check your Twilio console for your actual phone number - this is what customers will forward to!

## üîß Current Configuration

You currently have:
- **Voice webhook**: `https://api.vapi.ai/twilio/inbound_call` (VAPI)
- **Status webhook**: `https://api.vapi.ai/twilio/status` (VAPI)

## ‚úèÔ∏è What You Need to Change

### Step 1: Choose Your Deployment Method

Before changing Twilio, you need a public URL for your server:

**Option A: ngrok (for testing - 2 minutes)**
```bash
# In a new terminal (keep npm run dev running):
ngrok http 3000

# Copy the https:// URL (e.g., https://abc123.ngrok.io)
```

**Option B: Railway (for production - 15 minutes)**
- Deploy to Railway (see DEPLOYMENT_CHECKLIST.md)
- Get your Railway URL (e.g., https://your-app.railway.app)

### Step 2: Update Twilio Configuration

Go to: https://console.twilio.com/us1/develop/phone-numbers/manage/active
Click on your Twilio phone number

#### Voice Configuration Section:

**Change "A call comes in" to:**
```
Webhook: https://YOUR-URL-HERE/incoming-call
HTTP Method: POST
```

Replace `YOUR-URL-HERE` with either:
- ngrok URL: `https://abc123.ngrok.io`
- Railway URL: `https://your-app.railway.app`

**Change "Call status changes" (optional but recommended):**
```
Leave blank or use: https://YOUR-URL-HERE/call-status
HTTP Method: POST
```

Click **"Save configuration"** at the bottom!

## üß™ Testing Before You Change

1. **Make sure your server is running:**
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1: Your server
   npm run dev

   # Terminal 2: ngrok (if using ngrok)
   ngrok http 3000
   ```

2. **Verify health endpoint works:**
   - ngrok: Visit `https://your-ngrok-url.ngrok.io/health`
   - Railway: Visit `https://your-railway-url.railway.app/health`

   Should return:
   ```json
   {"status":"ok","activeSessions":0,"timestamp":"..."}
   ```

3. **Now safe to update Twilio!**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### If using ngrok:
- URL changes every time you restart ngrok
- Need to update Twilio webhook each time
- **Only for testing!**

### If using Railway/Render:
- URL stays the same forever
- Set it once and forget it
- **Recommended for production**
